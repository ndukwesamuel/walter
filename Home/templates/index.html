            I came into Tech Studio Academy with practically no prior knowledge
            in software development. However, within a few weeks, I was able to
            grasp the crux of software development and also master the soft
            skills required for being a software developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            So far so good, the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing
            push in my career as a software developer.

            Tech Studio Academy has been one of the big push I needed to get in
            the real world space. I had an immense learning that was really
            different from the self learning I started with. The learning was
            fun and there were some internship job opportunities that were
            presented to us. I got my first gig immediately after the program.

          <p>Thank you Tech Studio for that push I needed.</p>

              <h3>Why Is This Course Relevant Today?</h3>
              <p>
                There's never been a better time to start a career as a web
                developer because there is a consistent demand for developers
                who both write high-quality code and experienced problem solvers
                who can design creative solutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                The web and the applications built for it have transformed the
                way we do business globally, and is disrupting industries from
                education to manufacturing.
              </p>

                By the end of the course, you will have gained practice in the
                most used web-based programming language â€“ JavaScript. Youâ€™ll
                have built several full-stack applications of varying
                complexity, and have experience working with a team in a
                development environment.

                ever-changing field. Youâ€™ll have gained foundational skill in
                many disciplines that touch web development â€“ managing complex
                data sets, securing your applications with encrypted passwords,
                and testing and deploying your applications to prepare them to
                scale.
              </p>

                4GB RAM with a storage capacity of at least 350GB. The course
                will walk you through installing the necessary free software.
              </p>

                At least, youâ€™ll require basic secondary school mathematics, but
                no previous programming language experience is required.
